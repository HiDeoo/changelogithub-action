## Features

This GitHub action is a small wrapper for [`changelogithub`](https://github.com/antfu/changelogithub) to generate Changelog for GitHub releases from Conventional Commits.

Created by [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu) who deserves all the credits, `changelogithub` is a great tool but is [not a GitHub Action](https://github.com/antfu/changelogithub/issues/5#issuecomment-1154179110) which makes it a bit more difficult to get the newly created release ID or URL as output variables.

This GitHub Action uses a [slightly patched](/patches/changelogithub%400.12.7.patch) version of `changelogithub` to access the GitHub API response returned when creating a release and outputs the _release ID_, _release URL_ and _release upload URL_ as output variables.

## Usage

You can also check out the [`changelogithub` documentation](https://github.com/antfu/changelogithub#usage) for more informations.

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'

jobs:
  release:
    name: Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Install Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:

        uses: hideoo/changelogithub-action@v1

> **Note**
> You can also use the `hideoo/changelogithub-action@v1.x.x` syntax to pin the action to a specific version.
